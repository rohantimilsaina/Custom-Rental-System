# Custom-Rental-System

*This repository contains the source code and documentation for my university coursework project, implemented in Python. The project was undertaken as part of my academic curriculum to demonstrate my understanding of various concepts and skills in Python programming.

Costume Rental System
This project was assigned to us as a university project, focusing on the Python programming language. Python is a widely-used computer programming language known for its versatility, and it finds applications in various domains, including web development, process automation, and data analysis.

Project Overview
The objective of this coursework was to develop an application for a Costume Rental System. This application needed to read data from a text file, displaying a list of available costumes for rental. Additionally, it was required to generate invoices for customers after each costume rental transaction, which would then be recorded in a file. The application also had to manage costume inventory and create individual notes or invoices for each rental and return transaction.

Key Features
Here are the key features of the Costume Rental Shop Application:

Costume Catalog: The application would read from a text file and display a catalog of available costumes for rental.

Rental Transactions: Customers could rent costumes, and the application would create a note or invoice for each transaction. The note/invoice would include details such as the costume name, brand, client's name, rental date and time, and the total cost.

Multi-Costume Rentals: Customers had the option to rent multiple costumes, and the application was designed to calculate the total cost for all selected costumes.

Costume Returns: When a customer returned a costume, the application would generate a new note or invoice with details such as the customer's name, the costume's name, brand, return date, and time.

Rental Term: A standard rental term of five days was set for all costumes.

Late Returns: In cases of late returns, the application would assess a daily fine and record it in the transaction file.

Learning Experience
This project provided a valuable learning experience in Python programming. It required us to work through various challenges, improving our understanding of the language and its practical applications. The process of developing this application allowed us to gain hands-on experience in file handling, data processing, and user interaction in Python.

We anticipated that this project would not only enhance our programming skills but also provide us with insights into real-world applications of Python, particularly in managing inventory and generating invoices for a costume rental business.

This GitHub repository serves as a documentation hub for the Costume Rental Shop Application project, where you can find code and additional resources related to this coursework. I hope that sharing my project here may also benefit others looking to explore Python programming in similar contexts.
